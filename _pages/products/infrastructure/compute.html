      <h4><strong>About Compute solutions</strong></h4>
      <p class = 'profile-text'>Computing infrastructure is behind many company applications and data in the form of delivering accessibility, availability, security and ensuring the integrity of critical information assets.</p>
      <br>
      <p class = 'profile-text'>With the advances in technology real-time analytics, server and application virtualization, high performance computing (HPC) are within the reach of the average business but not all CPUs and server architectures are created the same. Different workloads and applications have different performance characteristics and therefore may demand different computing resources. But how do you select the right computing resources? Where is the balance between specialization and standardization?</p>
      <br>
      <h4><strong>What are the advantages of Compute solutions?</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>  Run anything—Optimize any application and store all data on a single infrastructure with fluid pools of physical and virtual compute, storage, and fabric.</li>
        <li>Move faster—Accelerate application and service delivery through a single  interface that precisely composes logical infrastructures at near-instant speeds.</li>
        <li>Work smarter—Reduce operational effort and cost through internal software defined intelligence with template driven, frictionless operations.</li>
        <li>Unlock value—Increase productivity and control across the data center by integrating and automating infrastructure operations and applications through a unified API.</li>
      </ul>
