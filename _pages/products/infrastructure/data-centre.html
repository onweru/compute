      <h4><strong>About Data Centres</strong></h4>
      <p class = 'profile-text'>Known as the server farm or the computer room, the data center is where the majority of an enterprise servers and storage are located, operated and managed.</p>
      <p class = 'profile-text'><strong>White space:</strong> This typically refers to the usable raised floor environment measured in square feet (anywhere from a few hundred to a hundred thousand square feet). For data centers that don’t use a raised floor environment, the term 'white space' may still be used to show usable square footage.</p>
      <p class = 'profile-text'><strong>Support infrastructure:</strong> This refers to the additional space and equipment required to support data center operations — including power transformers, your uninterruptible power source (UPS), generators, computer room air conditioners (CRACs), remote transmission units (RTUs), chillers, air distribution systems, etc. In a high-density, Tier 3 class data center (i.e. a concurrently maintainable facility), this support infrastructure can consume 4-6 times more space than the white space and must be accounted for in data center planning.</p>
      <p class = 'profile-text'><strong> IT equipment: </strong>This includes the racks, cabling, servers, storage, management systems and network gear required to deliver computing services to the organization.</p>
      <p class = 'profile-text'><strong> Operations: </strong> The operations staff assures that the systems (both IT and infrastructure) are properly operated, maintained, upgraded and repaired when necessary. In most companies, there is a division of responsibility between the Technical Operations group in IT and the staff responsible for the facilities support systems.</p>
