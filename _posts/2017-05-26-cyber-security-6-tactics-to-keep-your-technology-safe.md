The recent WannaCry ransomware attack that affected over 100, 000 computers across the world has shown just how vital an effective cyber security strategy is for any forward thinking organization. It has brought into focus key elements of cyber defense such as **Patch Management**, **Network Filtering**, **Antivirus Protection**, **Backups**, **Staff Security Awareness Training** and a comprehensive **Incident Response Plan**.

Becoming the target of a cyber attack is not a question of if, but when, an organization will be attacked. As such, businesses need to develop and implement effective and continuous incident response strategies. We recommend employing the following tactics:

### 1. Frequent patch management
Organizations should put in place a frequent vulnerability and infiltration detection program to regularly monitor weaknesses in their system and prompt patching, before the bad guys can exploit them and hold them to ransom.

### 2. Network Filtering and Management
The first line of defense against any attack is prevention. Businesses should centralize network administration to control what is allowed in and out of their networks. We have several effective filtering solutions that can significantly reduce your exposure to attacks as well as avert known cyber threats.

### 3. Antivirus Protection and Whitelisting
Organizations that use proven anti-virus protection are able to cushion themselves against malicious attacks and possible loss of sensitive data. With advancement in antivirus technology, some antivirus programs have the capability for behavior-based detection that protects systems against new and never-encountered threats.

For instance, Kaspersky Labs, our strategic partner in IT security, has a behavior-based packer detection technology integrated in Kaspersky Internet Security and other Kaspersky Lab products that effectively detects and blocks any concealed malicious code. This ensures that potentially dangerous code is then countered and eliminated.

Another prevention strategy is Whitelisting, an approach that blocks unknown programs from running and allows only known and verified applications to run on your computer. Organizations should complement their security strategies by employing a whitelist-based approach.

### 4. Frequent Data Backups**
Organizations should regularly maintain backups to their critical data and ensure they can recover them in case of a disaster. Fortunately, the advent of cloud technology, spearheaded by global leaders like Microsoft, has made it relatively easier and cost-effective for businesses to schedule automatic data backups using Microsoft Azure. This ensures business continuity and minimal costs in the events of a disaster.

### 5. Staff Security Awareness Training
Through security awareness training, organizations can raise staff awareness of the daily cyber risks they face, and suggest actions and procedures to adopt to minimize such risks. An effective security awareness program should be a continuous process that keeps your team updated throughout whenever any employee-related security incidents happen.

### 6. Incident Response Strategy. 
It is essential for organizations to have a well thought out, comprehensive incident response strategy. Reactionary responses to incidents are ineffective, costly, and not sustainable as the threats keep evolving and getting more complex.

Overall, we recommend that your organization not only focuses on todayâ€™s threats but to remain vigilant and forward thinking in order to anticipate potential threats.
