As the modern workforce becomes more mobile and more people work remotely, business leaders are recognizing the many benefits video conferencing can provide to their businesses. Over the years, <a href="http://www.computechlimited.com/cisco.html">Computech Limited</a> has been enabling businesses to leverage video conferencing and other collaboration technologies in order to significantly scale productivity and reduce costs.

Here are 5 specific reasons for businesses to invest in video conferencing solutions:

**1. Better Communication = Improved relationships**

As businesses expand, teams are established outside of HQ, whether in satellite offices or new branches. However, limited face-to-face communication between different teams can cause misunderstandings and hinder productivity. Nevertheless, expanding your geographic reach shouldn’t impact the ability of your teams to work together and continue driving the business as one unit. Video collaboration breaks this barrier making it feel as though your teams are in the same room, enhancing the quality of communication and team relationships.

**2. Save Money and Time**

Video conferencing enables you to conduct virtual face-to-face meetings, saving hours and dollars that would otherwise be used travelling. This way, you can allocate more resources to helping your customers (and your own business!) solve their most pressing problems.

**3. Collaborate with Anyone at Any Time in Any Place**

Video collaboration tools enable flexible and remote working across your organization to help boost productivity. For example, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/conferencing/webex-meeting-center/index.html">Cisco WebEx Meeting Center</a> allows you to facilitate project reviews and team meetings with colleagues no matter where they are. Everyone is happy – individuals can work remotely, teams can work together, and more gets done.

**4.   ****Support your Customers**

Video conferencing comes in handy when you want to troubleshoot a challenge that your customer might be facing. Collaboration tools enable screen and data sharing between participants helping you get your customers back on track, no matter where they are located or what problems they face.

**5. Connect with your Customers**

Video collaboration tools enable you to connect directly with customers as if you were in the same room. Whether it’s a live product demo or an important meeting with stakeholders seated in different places, video conferencing reduces the distance between your business and your customer, fostering stronger relationships, better customer service, and increasing customer touch points.
