## Introducing Microsoft Teams 

We've seen the impact teamwork has had on our world, but what if teams could achieve even more? To truly do great work, we need people that have different experiences and understand the world from a different perspective.

The thing that's challenging is to make sure that there's a platform for that collaboration. Teams are very liquid. We need to keep up with the way our people like to work.

What if people from different cultures and generations could come together in a more purposeful way so ideas flow freely and evolve organically?

Just imagine what we could achieve.

Introducing Microsoft Teams in Office 365. 

### What is Microsoft Teams? 

Microsoft Teams is a chat-based workspace that gives people one place to connect and create in inherently human ways.

It is a unified communication and collaboration platform that combines persistent workplace chat, video meetings, file storage (including collaboration on files), and application integration. The service integrates with the company's Office 365 subscription office productivity suite and features extensions that can integrate with non-Microsoft products. 

### How does Microsoft Teams work? 

You may ask a number of questions such as:

- Is Microsoft Teams User-Friendly?
- Is it compatible with other Office 365 tools?
- Is it smooth and easy to use?
- Will it support my department functions?
- Can I multitask office work with Teams?

Well, instead of providing a tail of answers, we saw that it would be better to immerse you into the feel of using Microsoft teams with our interactive Demo.
