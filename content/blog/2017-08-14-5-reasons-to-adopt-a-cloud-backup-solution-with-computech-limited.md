Protecting enterprise data is essential for survival of any business. With the ever-increasing threats of cyberattacks, businesses without a sound data backup and disaster recovery plan are continuing to lose critical assets and their competitive edge. However, traditional methods of data protection have been proven to be difficult, unreliable, and expensive, especially with the large volume of data that modern businesses now store and process.

There is a solution though! Thanks to cloud technologies, businesses can now benefit from fast, secure, and reliable disaster recovery plans while reducing costs and downtime. Computech Limited’s experienced team will be able to guide you on the best solution to meet your needs and provide you with the support to implement this every step of the way.

Here are 5 key reasons why businesses should consider adopting a cloud backup solution with Computech Limited:

### Disaster Recovery

Backing up your data on the cloud ensures it is saved offsite in a secondary data center to safeguard against loss should anything happen to your primary data center. This means that you can easily access and restore your data within minutes minimizing the costs associated with disasters and downtime

### Data Protection and Security

Cloud technology providers have made huge investments in data security and protection. By backing up your critical data on the cloud, you are protecting it with the world’s best encryption techniques where only authorized users with the correct keys can decrypt it.

### Time Saving

Using traditional backup methods is not only tedious but time-consuming. This becomes a challenge especially to organizations with limited IT staff. Fortunately, businesses can now automate workloads for backup using the cloud. In addition to standardizing your backup processes, this automation frees up your IT staff enabling them to focus on more strategic IT functions of your business.

### Predictable costs

With cloud backup solutions, you only pay for what you use, enabling businesses to scale up and down when necessary. Since these solutions normally charge a monthly price for backup, you can easily predict and plan your expenses.

### Compliance

Most governments across the world require businesses to store their data off their primary site of operations. Furthermore, organizations might be required to store their data for a certain period to facilitate auditing and compliance. With cloud backup solutions like Microsoft Azure, you can have the peace of mind that comes with the automatic data backup to an offsite data center, and retain it for access any time it is needed

Many organizations don’t backup their data until a disaster strikes, and when they do, they use traditional methods that can’t sufficiently cope with their requirements and they end up losing their critical data. Our portfolio includes the world’s best cloud backup and disaster recovery solutions to protect your mission-critical assets from disasters, cyberattacks, system failures, and even human error, because we want your business to operate optimally all the time.
