The University of Nairobi (UON), one of the largest educational in- stitutions based in Nairobi, Kenya, was seeking to centralize dis- jointed operations of its numerous departments. The students were following up with each department independently for different ser- vices, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. The collegiate research university needed to have a single point of contact for all the process- es for students. Besides this, UON also required to automate its call center floor and identify agents
who best serve a query.

The customer expected the
solution to benefit all key functional service areas of the University, such as, Student Admission Center, Student Advising and Retention, Examination Center, Registrars’ Offices, IT Service Desk, Corporate Affair, Advancement, Procurement and all University Campuses and Extra-Mural Centers spread across all over the country.

UON selected Computech Lim- ited, a leading East African systems integrator, well-known for providing pioneering technology solutions to solve businesses’ challenges over the past 30 years. The solu- tions provider evaluated the cus- tomer requirements and identified the offerings available within the broad Cisco portfolio and specifi- cally within Cisco Solution Partners available under the vendor’s Solu- tionPlus Program to come up with an end-to-end solution to address
the customer’s challenge.

Dipak Galaiya, Group Chief Com-
mercial Officer, Computech Limited, says,“WiththehelpofCiscoUnified Contact Center Express solution, we created a comprehensive Cus- tomer Experience Center that will facilitate and improve services de- livery and customer satisfaction.”

Cisco Unified Contact Center Express provides a secure, avail- able, and sophisticated contact center software solution and inter- active voice response (IVR) ports that is easy to deploy and manage.

“Any contact center solution is not an all-in-one product. Our technical experts integrated the solution with a number of other applications to meet the complete customer requirement.”

One of the challenges Compu- tech experienced was coming up with a single view for all the previous separate systems within the Univer- sity and presenting the collected information to the Contact Centre agents. Thanks to its years of mar- ket knowledge and Cisco’s intuitive solution, Computech was able to overcome the challenge expertly.

Post the implementation, which took six months to com- plete, UON was able to enjoy faster response times to student queries and have a single point of contact for all aspects of student’s activities such as fee payments, course reg- istrations, transcripts, hostel, and accommodations. Additionally, the University was also able to provide and monitor quality assurance at its call center, which helped to improve and train the team. The new de- ployment also allowed UON to have flexible schedule management for agents that were available for dif- ferent shifts. The customer could also now interact with students and other stakeholders via social me- dia platforms and emails. An added benefit was being able to provide reports on usage, providing fur- ther insights on different channels, which were useful to the center.

Computech has significant expe- rience across industry sectors, prod- ucts and services, with substantial work done in providing professional services, infrastructure solutions, technical support, and technology outsourcing to all sectors.

Galaiya adds, “We also provid- ed continuous training to both the technical team and the call center agents as value addition and a part of our post sales customer experi- ence strategy."
