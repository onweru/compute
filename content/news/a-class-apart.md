_Dipak Galaiya, group chief commercial officer, computech limited, gives an overview of how the leading systems integrator supported university of nairobi in creating a comprehensive customer experience center._

[The University of Nairobi (UON)](https://uonbi.ac.ke/), one of the largest educational institutions based in Nairobi, Kenya, was seeking to centralize disjointed operations of its numerous departments. The students were following up with each department independently for different services, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. The collegiate research university needed to have a single point of contact for all the processes for students. Besides this, UON also required to automate its call center floor and identify agents
who best serve a query.

The customer expected the solution to benefit all key functional service areas of the University, such as, Student Admission Center, Student Advising and Retention, Examination Center, Registrars’ Offices, IT Service Desk, Corporate Affair, Advancement, Procurement and all University Campuses and Extra-Mural Centers spread across all over the country.

__UON selected [Computech Limited](/)__, a leading East African systems integrator, well-known for providing pioneering technology solutions to solve businesses’ challenges over the past 30 years. The solutions provider evaluated the customer requirements and identified the offerings available within the broad Cisco portfolio and specifically within Cisco Solution Partners available under the vendor’s SolutionPlus Program to come up with an end-to-end solution to address
the customer’s challenge.

Dipak Galaiya, Group Chief Commercial Officer, Computech Limited, says,

“With the help of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express solution, we created a comprehensive Customer Experience Center that will facilitate and improve services delivery and customer satisfaction.”

Cisco Unified Contact Center Express provides a secure, available, and sophisticated contact center software solution and interactive voice response (IVR) ports that is easy to deploy and manage.

“Any contact center solution is not an all-in-one product. Our technical experts integrated the solution with a number of other applications to meet the complete customer requirement.”

One of the challenges Computech experienced was coming up with a single view for all the previous separate systems within the University and presenting the collected information to the Contact Centre agents. Thanks to its years of market knowledge and Cisco’s intuitive solution, Computech was able to overcome the challenge expertly.

Post the implementation, which took six months to complete, UON was able to enjoy faster response times to student queries and have a single point of contact for all aspects of student’s activities such as fee payments, course registrations, transcripts, hostel, and accommodations. Additionally, the University was also able to provide and monitor quality assurance at its call center, which helped to improve and train the team. The new deployment also allowed UON to have flexible schedule management for agents that were available for different shifts. The customer could also now interact with students and other stakeholders via social media platforms and emails. An added benefit was being able to provide reports on usage, providing further insights on different channels, which were useful to the center.

Computech has significant experience across industry sectors, products and services, with substantial work done in providing professional services, infrastructure solutions, technical support, and technology outsourcing to all sectors.

 Galaiya adds, “We also provided continuous training to both the technical team and the call center agents as value addition and a part of our post sales customer experience strategy." <br><br>
