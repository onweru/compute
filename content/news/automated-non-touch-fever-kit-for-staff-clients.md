Currently, there is an unprecedented increase in __Temperature Scans__ happening around the world due to circumstances resulting from __COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease)__. The __World Health Organization__ recommends a __1-meter social distancing measure__ to curb the spread of this deadly virus during the Temperature Scanning process.

__Computech Limited__ is providing an effective __automated__ and __non-human operated solution__ that will address your companyâ€™s Fever Kit concerns to __protect__ your staff & clients from __COVID-19 infection__, during and after sans.

Introducing the __non-contact/touch Fever Kit__ that is currently being used by __NASA__ to detect the surface temperature of the forehead, from 5 inches (distance), while using the best __IR Radiometer invented__. 

### How does it work?

This effective Fever Kit is a __no-touch, portable device__ designed to screen people for fever.
