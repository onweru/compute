Computech Limited wants to wish you a Happy Ramadan. Wishing a blessed Ramadan that will inspire you with courage and strength that will help you to win every challenge of life!

As you pray and fast at home with your family and friends, may Allah ease your hardships and shower you with loads of peace and prosperity during this Holy month of Ramadan. 

Stay Safe, Sanitize and Maintain the recommended Social Distance during fellowship and gatherings in this Holy Month of Ramadan to protect yourself and your Muslim Brothers & Sisters from the Covid-19 Virus.

Even if movement to the Mosque is restricted, let this not alter your Faith. Times may be hard for now but remember one thing. Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that. So, no matter how hard it gets, stick to prayer and fellowship with your fellow brothers and sisters in Faith and eventually the best will come out from this situation.

May __Allah__ fill your home with warmth and peace. Happy Ramadan!
