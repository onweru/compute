Always expect a surprise while working at Computech Limited. At least that is what our staff got during the Customer Service Week. An early morning full course and scrumptious breakfast to appreciate them for their industrious culture and putting their foot forward to always serve the customer in a timely, hospitable and effective manner.
Kudos to the computech Family for always putting the Customer First!
