We are proud to announce our __New business Partnership__ with D3 Security. Frost and Sullivan, a global research and consulting firm, recently named __D3 Security’s__ Next-Generation __SOAR__ Platform as the Top SOAR Solution for Client Value.

[Read the Frost and Sullivan SOAR Report](https://d3security.com/resources/soar-best-practices-report/) – and learn how the combination of security orchestration, automation and response with the MITRE ATT&CK framework maximized value for SOAR customers.


### What makes it Different from the other SOAR Platforms?

Key D3 differentiators uncovered by Frost and Sullivan included:

- __Codeless Playbooks__ – Unlike other SOAR platforms, D3 does not require Python coding skills to create, modify and scale playbooks, saving SOC and IR teams time and resources.
- __MITRE ATT&CK__ – D3 has the ATT&CK framework built-in, offering automated correlation of attacker techniques which proactively identifies suspicious behavior and kills critical threats.
- __Robust Incident Case Management__ – Incident response, case management, evidence tracking and audit trail generation are made automated and consistent with the D3 solution, with dramatic reductions in response time and resources required.
