Computech Limited would like to take this moment to wish you a happy Eid ul Fitr. As you break your fast, remember to stay safe and stay home as you celebrate this Holy Day. 

Sanitize, maintain social distancing measures and be cautious and eventually we will eventually flatten the curve.

This is the day when we should pay gratitude to the divine light for all the wonderful things around us. Let this day bring new hope and opportunities in your life. May you welcome them with an open mind and fresh thoughts.
