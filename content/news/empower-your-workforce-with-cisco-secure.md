These uncertain times have caused a fundamental shift in the way we work. Offices are slowly opening back up. Some employees can't wait to return, while others want to continue to __work from home__.

This remote work culture isn’t going away any time soon. We have given birth to the Hybrid Work culture that has been adopted and widely accepted to be much more productive than the __in-office__ work culture. Despite a tumultuous year in 2020, remote workers report a __Workforce Happiness Index__ of __75 out of 100__, compared to 71 for in-office employees. And, remote employees are more likely to report being satisfied with their jobs than office-based workers (57% vs. 50%).

However, with all this said, this culture leaves the __remote worker vulnerable__ to significant security attacks because many organizations haven’t fully developed their remote security environment. Want to learn how you can securely empower your remote workforce? Let’s walk you through it.

### Why Cisco Secure Remote Worker?
