### Do More with Automation.

Taking into consideration of the unprecedented COVID-19 Crisis, movement has been limited due the Work from Home Policy. The need for I.T. Automation has risen due to the evolving remote-work culture.
Complex IT infrastructures require you to manage traditional and modern applications on private and public networks. This takes a lot of manual effort and complicated coordination across all of your IT teams. If you could automate these tasks, your teams would be free to deliver more value to the business.
Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is the simplest way to automate IT. Ansible is the only automation language that can:

- __Be used across entire IT teams: systems and network admins, developers, and managers.__
- __Automate your entire application life cycle, from servers to clouds to containers, and everything in between.__
- __Help teams manage complex multitier deployments by adding control, knowledge, and delegation.__

### Why Red Hat Ansible?

With Ansible Automation Platform, you gain control. It layers control, knowledge, and delegation on top of __Ansibleâ€™s__ simple, __powerful automation engine__. A visual dashboard centralizes and controls your infrastructure and displays:

- __Everything going on in our Ansible environment.__
- __Role-based access control.__
- __Job scheduling.__
- __Graphical inventory management.__

As your business relies more heavily on technology, it becomes more vulnerable to __security threats__. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform makes regulatory and infrastructure compliance more proactive. You can:

- __Apply corporate compliance and governance policies across all environments.__
- __Identify and manage security vulnerabilities faster.__
- __More proactively respond to breaches.__
 
We look forward to talking with you on how you can: deliver, deploy, and manage I.T. services faster with Red Hat.
