History Teaches us Lessons. Positive ones that we can build on to become greater individuals & strive to build our nation.
We take this opportunity to commemorate all those who put their lives on the frontline of the Multi-party struggle with a vision of a democratic republic and a country that embraces political freedom.

__Where there is unity there is always victory.__
