The modern workplace is ever changing and evolving from the Traditional __9-5 desk job__, to a remote working culture where one is __always on the go.__

The transition might be challenging at first, but inevitably this working culture is __here to stay.__ Putting in mind that the Corona Virus Pandemic has been a fundamental catalyst in speeding up this workplace revolution. Permanent desk jobs are now phrases coined in the past. This is the new normal. __#newnormal.__

Research done in 2019 showed that 50 percent of workers would be working from home by 2020 to meet the productivity goals of most companies. Most security experts had one question in place: __"The staff have left the workplace building, are they protected while working remotely?"__
