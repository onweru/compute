- term: Next Gen Firewall
  description: "A next-generation firewall (NGFW) is a hardware- or software-based network security system that is able to detect and block sophisticated attacks by enforcing security policies at the application level, as well as at the port and protocol level."

- term: Internal Firewall
  description: "This is a device similar to a next generation firewall but deployed to monitor internal traffic in an organization"

- term: Unified Threat Management                                     
  description: "UTM is the evolution of the traditional firewall into an all-inclusive security product able to perform multiple security functions within one single system: network firewalling, network intrusion detection/prevention (IDS/IPS), gateway antivirus (AV), gateway anti-spam, VPN, content filtering, load balancing, data loss prevention, and on-appliance reporting."
   
- term:  Network Access Control                                  
  description: "Network Access Control is an approach to computer security that attempts to unify endpoint security technology (such as antivirus, host intrusion prevention, and vulnerability assessment), user or system authentication and network security enforcement."                              
- term:  Identity & Access Management
  description: "An identity management access (IAM) system is a framework for business processes that facilitates the management of electronic identities. The framework includes the technology needed to support identity management."

- term: Anti DDOS
  description: "A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attack in which multiple compromised computer systems attack a target, such as a server, website or other network resource, and cause a denial of service for users of the targeted resource."

- term: Wifi Protection
  description: " Wireless security is the prevention of unauthorized access or damage to computers using wireless network."

- term: Internet Of Things Security
  description: "IoT security is the area of endeavor concerned with safeguarding connected devices and networks in the Internet of things (IoT). The Internet of Things involves the increasing prevalence of objects and entities – known, in this context as things -- provided with unique identifiers and the ability to automatically transfer data over a network."

- term: Database Access Management
  description: "Database activity monitoring (DAM) / Database Firewall (DBF) monitors database activity to identify fraudulent, illegal or other undesirable behavior, by using  embedded knowledge about database structures and access to analytics and reporting and enforce policies and control. The DAM/DBF solutions operates independently of the database management system (DBMS) audit functionality of the database itself. The DAM/DBF can be regarded to either as an alternative to the DBMS functionality (due to heavy overload on the database servers), either as complementary control to it."

- term: Web Application Firewall
  description: "A WAF can be either network-based or host-based and is typically deployed through a proxy and placed in front of one or more Web applications. In real time or near-real time, it monitors traffic before it reaches the Web application, analyzing all requests using a rule base to filter out potentially harmful traffic or traffic patterns."
  
- term: Multi Factor Authentication                                  
  description: "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a method of computer access control in which a user is only granted access after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism – typically at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know), possession (something they have), and inherence (something they are)."

- term: Anti Web Page Hijacking                                     
  description: "Web Page hijacking is a technical form of redirecting Web traffic that exploits certain glitches in search engines. Page hijacking involves creating a site that roughly duplicates the content of an existing site."

- term:  Anti Man In The Middle Attacks
  description: "Man-in-the-middle attack is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other."

- term: Application Security
  description: "Application security is the use of software, hardware, and procedural methods to protect applications from external threats. Priviledged Identity and Access Management."

- term: Priviledged Identity
  description: "Privileged identity management (PIM) is the monitoring and protection of superuser accounts in an organization’s IT environments. PAM is a secure, streamlined way to authorize and monitor all privileged users for all relevant systems."

- term: Intrusion Prevention 
  description: "An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Intrusion prevention is a preemptive approach to network security used to identify potential threats and respond to them swiftly."

- term: Security Incident
  description: "security information and event management (SIEM) software products and services combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). They provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications."

- term: Fraud Management
  description: "Offences that are committed against individuals or groups of individuals with a criminal motive to intentionally harm the reputation of the victim or cause physical or mental harm, or loss, to the victim directly or indirectly, using modern telecommunication networks."

- term: IT Disaster Recovery & Mgmnt
  description: "Disaster recovery (DR) is an area of security planning that aims to protect an organization from the effects of significant negative events. DR allows an organization to maintain or quickly resume mission-critical functions following a disaster."

- term: Bring Your Own Device Mgmnt
  description: "Bring your own device (BYOD)—also called bring your own technology (BYOT), bring your own phone (BYOP), and bring your own Personal Computer (BYOPC)—refers to the policy of permitting employees to bring personally owned devices (laptops, tablets, and smart phones) to their workplace, and to use those devices to access privileged company information and applications."
